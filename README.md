the code starts with two lists, one called "key" and another called "value",
first there is an input called "add" that asks the user if he wants to assign a grade to someone, 
if so, he is taken to a while loop, which asks for the student's name and their grade, 
this data is added to the two lists, when the user does not want to assign grades anymore, 
just type something other than "yes" in the "add" input, then the lists are integrated with its indexes in order,
making it just a list, the list is converted into a dictionary, and finally the dictionary is printed
